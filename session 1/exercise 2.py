#Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡

# print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
#   print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
# print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")


# we should print like this:
# Day 1 - String Manipulation
# String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
# e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
# New lines can be created with a backslash and n.

# answer:

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

# or with the ez way
print("""
Day 1 - String Manipulation
String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
New lines can be created with a backslash and n.
""") # triple quote is overkill :3

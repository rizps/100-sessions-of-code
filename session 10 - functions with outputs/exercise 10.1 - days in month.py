# days in month
# In the starting code, you'll find the solution from the Leap Year challenge.
# First, convert this function is_leap() so that instead of printing "Leap year." or "Not leap year."
# it should return True if it is a leap year and return False if it is not a leap year.
#
# You are then going to create a function called days_in_month() which will take a year and a month as inputs, e.g.
# days_in_month(year=2022, month=2)
# And it will use this information to work out the number of days in the month, then return that as the output, e.g.:
# 28
#
# The List month_days contains the number of days in a month from January to December for a non-leap year.
# A leap year has 29 days in February.

# def is_leap(year):
#     if year % 4 == 0:
#         if year % 100 == 0:

#         else:

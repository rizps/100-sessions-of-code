# is leap year or not
# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
#
# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
# **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100
# **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400
#
# e.g. The year 2000:
# 2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)
# 2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
# 2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)
# So the year 2000 is a leap year.
#
# But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:
# 2100 Ã· 4 = 525 (Leap)
# 2100 Ã· 100 = 21 (Not Leap)
# 2100 Ã· 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
#
# #Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# make an algorithm
# x % 4 == 0 = leap
#   x % 100 == 0 = not leap
#   x % 100 != 0 = leap
#       x % 400 == 0 = leap
#       x % 400 != 0 = not leap


# if year % 4 == 0:
#     if year % 100 == 0:
#       if year % 400 == 0:
#           print('Leap year.')
#       else:
#           print('Not leap year.')
#     else:
#         print('Leap year.')
# else:
#     print('Not leap year.')

# lets simplify the code
# because when 100 and 400 are correspond to each other, so we can bundle it
# and when leap it should be true
